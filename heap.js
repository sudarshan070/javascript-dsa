// A heap is a specialized **tree-based data structure** which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property.
// A common implementation of heap is a binary heap, in which tree is a binary tree.
// If parent at 0th index,its two childe node are at 1st and 2nd position in the array. Here's relationship between childe node and parent node in a binary heap.
// The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.
// max heap and min heap.

// min heap 
// if P is parent node of the C, then the key of P is less than or equal to key of C.

// max heap 
// The key of P is greater than of equal to key of C.
